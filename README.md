#Guessing Game

In the first assignment "Guessing Game" we have a picker who picks a number between 1-10 and gives the number to the referee. Then we have 3 players who try to guess the number. The referee tells them if they guessed it right or not. The number pick and guesses are human input. As a program enhancement I made sure the picker picks the number between 1 and 10. If he does not, the program prompts him to pick a valid number until he picks right. Then the program asks the players one by one to guess the number the picker picked. Program asks each player with their player number as an enhancement. And also if they don't guess between 1 and 10 again the program prompts them until they guess in the correct range. After each player give their guesses the referee evaluates if any of them won or not. If no one predicts correctly, the referee takes their second guesses as an enhancement and continues this process until a correct number is given. The referee then tells who won and in how many tries he did so as an enhancement. If multiple players won, the referee declares multiple players as winners.
